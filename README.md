-- The complete code will be made available immediately once the paper is published online by Operations Research (INFORMS) --

This repository provides the latest C++ implementation of the L-shaped framework and the improvements that we used to write "Integrated backup train allocation and timetable rescheduling with uncertain time-variant passenger demand under disruptive events". Some sets of data samples are provided. The exact version as used while writing the manuscript can be found as an online supplement to the publication (doi url here).

If you have any questions, comments, and/or suggestions, please do not hesistate to contact us via jtyin@bjtu.edu.cn and lxyang@bjtu.edu.cn. If you found our code useful, then you can cite the work as follows:
